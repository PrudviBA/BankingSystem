# Banking System Project

 This repository contains a Banking System implemented in Java, showcasing fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts along with practical usage of Git and GitHub for project tracking and collaboration.

# 📝 Overview
The Banking System allows users to create and manage different types of bank accounts, such as SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount, while demonstrating OOP principles like Polymorphism and Abstraction. This project also serves as a practical guide to using Git and GitHub for version control.
# 🔑 Features
## 1. Interface
`Banking_Operations`: Defines essential banking operations :<br>
1.Deposit <br>
2.Withdraw <br>
3.View balance <br>
## 2. Classes
`SavingsAccount:` <br>
1.Handles operations specific to savings accounts. <br>
2.Placeholder for future interest rate calculation functionality.<br>
3.Includes deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry.<br>
`CurrentAccount:`<br>

1.Manages current account operations.<br>
2.Provides overdraft capability in future versions.<br>
`Bank:` <br>

1.Maintains a collection of all accounts.<br>
2.Demonstrates aggregation through account management.<br>
`Main:`

1.Provides a user interface via the console.<br>
2.Offers menu-driven operations for account management.<br>
# 🚀 How to Run
### -> Clone this repository<br>
### -> Open in IDE<br>
### -> Run the Project:<br>
1.Execute Main.java to interact with the banking system.<br>
2.Choose account type and perform operations like deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiries.<br>
# 🛠️ Git and GitHub Workflow
`This project showcases effective Git workflows for version control and feature tracking.`<br>
### Commands Used: <br>
1.Initialize Repository:<br>
`git init` <br>
2. Track Files: <br>
`git add <filename>`<br?
`git commit -m "Message"`<br>
3.Connect Remote Repository:<br>
`git remote add origin <repo-URL>`<br>
4.Push Changes:<br>
`git push origin master`
# Planned Features for Git Usage:
`Branching:` Implement additional features like interest rate calculation using a separate branch.<br>
`Pull Requests:` Simulate collaboration by merging branches into master.<br>

`Commit History:` Maintain detailed commit messages for tracking changes.<br>

# 🛠️ Future Enhancements
`Encapsulation:` 
Secure account details by implementing private variables with getter and setter methods.<br>
`Interest Rate Calculation:`
Automate interest accumulation for savings accounts.<br>
`Overdraft Management:`
Add overdraft capabilities for current accounts.<br>
`Graphical User Interface (GUI):`
Improve usability by developing a GUI-based version of the project.<br>
# 🎯 Purpose
`This project serves as a dual-purpose tool:`<br>

A demonstration of fundamental Java programming skills, including interfaces, classes, and OOP principles.<br>
A hands-on guide to using Git and GitHub workflows for real-world project tracking and feature management.<br>
